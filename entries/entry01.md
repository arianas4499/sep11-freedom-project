After looking through a list of tools. I decided to choose melon js. I was stuck between kaboom and melon. The only thing that was making me want to choose kaboom was the fact that you have to dowload something in order to be able to use melon js. However, I decided to stick to melon. Using melon I want to make a level-game based game, although I am not completely sure what specificlly I want the game to be about, I know that I want it to be a level-game based game as of now.
Before I commitied to melon js I had to tinker around with it to make sure that this was the tool I wanted to use. On the main melon js website there is a demo where you can see how certain games were made or how melon was involved in it. However, in order to use the demo you had to download 3 other files. After downloading one of the files, I needed to clone that into my ide where a bunch of different folders were cloned. This was honestly very helpful because every folder contained different things. They were labeled for different parts of the game. For instance there were folders for graphics, sprites, shapes and much more. The one that caught my eye was the whack-a-mole folder because inside the folder was a file for the mole specifically and another one for how to be able to display the score.
I am currently on the define and research the problem part of the engineering design process I believe that I will be on this part for a while, as we are still learning more about our tool. I will continue to tinker around with my tool to get ready to move on to the next stage of the engineering design process which is brainstorming solutions.
