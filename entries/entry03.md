In class we have been tinkering around with our tool to try and better understand it. I chose melon js to make a platform game where a character will be able to collect coins as it continues on its own path. Although things will change and more ideas will come as I continue to learn more about my tool.
I have been learning about my tool by using the demos/ examples given by the official melon js website. When cloning the whole demo into my IDE a bunch of files were created where I could see how different parts of different games were created and the code behind it. I’ve been using this to my advantage by messing around with certain parts of the code to see what would change if that part wasn’t there or what would happen if I added another one. For instance if I wanted to add particles to my game that were just floating around in the background I would add

js
‘
static floating: boolean = false
‘
‘ I thought that was pretty cool because I thought that making particles float around would require a lot more code.

Another thing that I found interesting was

‘
static tint string = #ffff

which allowed you to change the color of the particles.
