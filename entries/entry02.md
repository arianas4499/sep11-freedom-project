For this freedom projet I am working on Melon JS to make a level-based game. Although I am stil not sure of what speciffically I am going to make the game about.  I continue to tinker around with my tool to learn more about my tool and how I'll want to use it in the future.

    In order to tinker around with my tool I continued to use the demo provided by the website. This demo containes different files for different parts of different games. Today I decided to explore the file called "lights". This one had a background of a city and a light followed the mouse everywhere it moved. In order for this to be able to happen a code for the spot light only was made and then another for the light to follow the mouse. An important part of this code is "event.gameX" because this is what allows the light to follow the mouse. Another file that caught my attention was the particles file. This example was a little more longer because it required code for each key. There was code for the keyboard to be enabled but also code for the enter key. And also code for the mouse that allowed the mouse to move the particles.

    I am still on the define and research the problem part of the engineering design process. I will contninue to tinker with my tool to learn more and better understand it. I will also continue thinking about what game I want to make as I tinker around with my tool.
